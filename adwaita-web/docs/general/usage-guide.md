# Usage Guide for Adwaita Skin

Adwaita Skin is a pure CSS library that allows you to style standard HTML elements to match the Adwaita design language. It achieves this through a set of CSS classes that you can apply to your HTML structure.

This guide explains how to include the necessary CSS and provides general principles for using the class-based styling system.

## Including the CSS

To use Adwaita Skin, you need to include its compiled CSS file in your HTML document.

1.  **Get the CSS file:**
    The primary CSS file is `adwaita-skin.css`. This file is generated by compiling the SCSS source files located in the `scss/` directory of the `adwaita-web` project (e.g., using a SASS compiler with `scss/adwaita-skin.scss` as input). The build script `build-adwaita-web.sh` handles this compilation and places the output in `adwaita-web/css/adwaita-skin.css`.

2.  **Link the CSS in your HTML:**
    Add a `<link>` tag to the `<head>` of your HTML document, pointing to the location of `adwaita-skin.css`.

    ```html
    <head>
      <!-- ... other head elements ... -->
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your/css/adwaita-skin.css">
      <!--
        Example paths:
        - If adwaita-skin.css is in the same directory as your HTML:
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="adwaita-skin.css">
        - If it's in a css subdirectory:
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/adwaita-skin.css">
        - If using with the antisocialnet structure:
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/adwaita-skin.css') }}">
      -->
    </head>
    ```

## Applying Styles with CSS Classes

Adwaita Skin works by providing CSS classes that correspond to Adwaita widgets and their visual properties. You apply these classes directly to your HTML elements.

**General Pattern:**

```html
<element class="adw-widget-name [adw-modifier-class-1 adw-modifier-class-2 ...]">
  <!-- Content -->
</element>
```

*   `adw-widget-name`: This is the primary class that styles the element like a specific Adwaita widget (e.g., `adw-button`, `adw-entry`, `adw-list-box`).
*   `adw-modifier-class`: These are additional classes that alter the appearance or state of the base widget style (e.g., `suggested` or `destructive` for buttons, `disabled` for various elements, or classes for alignment and spacing like `adw-box-horizontal`).

**Example: Styling a Button**

To create a standard Adwaita button:
```html
<button class="adw-button">Click Me</button>
```

To create a "suggested action" button (typically blue):
```html
<button class="adw-button suggested">Save</button>
```

To create a "destructive action" button (typically red):
```html
<button class="adw-button destructive">Delete</button>
```

**Example: Styling an Entry (Text Input)**

```html
<input type="text" class="adw-entry" placeholder="Enter text here...">
```

## HTML Structure

While Adwaita Skin aims to be flexible, some styles might expect a certain HTML structure for optimal appearance, especially for more complex components like list boxes or header bars.

*   **Simple Elements:** For elements like buttons (`<button>`, `<a>`), entries (`<input>`), labels (`<span>`, `<label>`), styling is usually straightforward by applying the class to the element itself.
*   **Complex Structures:** For components like an `adw-action-row` within an `adw-list-box`, you'll need to create the corresponding HTML structure:

    ```html
    <div class="adw-list-box">
      <div class="adw-action-row">
        <span class="adw-row-title">Title for Action Row</span>
        <!-- Other content like subtitles or icons -->
      </div>
      <div class="adw-action-row">
        <span class="adw-row-title">Another Row</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    ```

Refer to the "Styled Elements (CSS Classes)" section in the main documentation and the examples provided in `adwaita-web/examples/` to see the recommended HTML structures and available classes for different Adwaita patterns.

## Interactivity

Adwaita Skin is a **pure CSS library**. It **does not provide any JavaScript** for interactivity.
*   Event handling (e.g., what happens when a button is clicked).
*   Dynamic updates to the UI (e.g., showing/hiding elements, changing content).
*   Complex widget behaviors (e.g., opening/closing dialogs, managing tabs).

All such interactivity must be implemented by your application using your own JavaScript code. Adwaita Skin provides the visual styling, and your JavaScript provides the functionality.

## Theming

Adwaita Skin supports theming (light/dark modes, accent colors) through CSS custom properties. Refer to the [Theming](./theming.md) documentation for details on how this works and how to customize it. The principles described there are still valid as they rely on CSS variables.

## Discovering Available Styles

The best ways to discover available CSS classes and their usage are:
1.  Explore the individual documentation pages for "Styled Elements (CSS Classes)" (linked from the main `README.md`).
2.  Examine the HTML example files in the `adwaita-web/examples/` directory.
3.  Inspect the SCSS source files in `adwaita-web/scss/` to see how styles are defined and what classes are available.

By using standard HTML and applying the Adwaita Skin CSS classes, you can build web interfaces that align with GNOME's design principles without relying on JavaScript frameworks or web components for the core styling.
