# This file makes 'routes' a Python package.

# You can optionally import blueprints here to make them available
# when 'from app-demo.routes import ...' is used, but it's often cleaner
# to register them in the main __init__.py or app.py.

# Example (will be defined in respective files):
# from .auth import auth_bp
# from .general import general_bp
# from .post import post_bp
# from .profile import profile_bp
# from .admin import admin_bp

# all_blueprints = [auth_bp, general_bp, post_bp, profile_bp, admin_bp]
